# Modernizing Data Analytics with SQL Server 2019

Businesses require near real-time insights from ever-larger sets of data. Large-scale data ingestion requires scale-out storage and processing in ways that allow fast response times. In addition to simply querying this data, organizations want full analysis and even predictive capabilities over their data.

Wide World Importers (WWI) is a traditional brick and mortar business with a long track record of success, generating profits through strong retail store sales of their unique offering of affordable products from around the world. Over the past few years, they have adopted an omni-channel strategy, meaning, different ways for consumers to purchase their products. These new platforms were added without integrating into the OLTP system data or Business Intelligence infrastructures. As a result, "silos" of data stores have developed.

Now, WWI is trying to cope with difficulties in combining these disparate data sources in varying formats into a single location where they can analyze the data in near real-time, joining related information where needed. They also want to be able to leverage AI to help their business grow and cut down maintenance costs. They would like to have all of these capabilities rolled into a single system, while minimizing code changes across their domain.
