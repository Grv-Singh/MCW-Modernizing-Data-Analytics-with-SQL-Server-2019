Refer to [the Azure Kubernetes Service product documentation](http://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/global-infrastructure/services/?products=kubernetes-service) for the up-to-date list of supported regions.

## Before the hands-on lab

Duration: 60 minutes

### Task 1: Install software on your own VM or system

The instructions that follow are the same for either your own system (desktop or laptop), or a Virtual Machine. It's best to have at least 4GB of RAM on the management system, and these instructions assume that you are not planning to run the database server or any Containers on the workstation. It's also assumed that you are using a current version of Windows, either desktop or server.

> **Note**: You can copy and paste all of the commands that follow in a PowerShell window that you run as the system Administrator.

> **Note**: For further information, please [refer to this link](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/big-data-cluster/deploy-get-started?view=sqlallproducts-allversions) for the latest installation instructions if you have problems running the steps below.

1. Open the [Azure Portal](https://portal.azure.com).

2. Create a new resource group called `mod-data-INIT` in a [supported AKS region](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/aks/availability-zones).

3. Under **Settings**, select **Export template**.

   ![The resource group left menu is displayed with Export template item highlighted.](media/before-hol-azure-region-setup.png 'select export template')

4. In the menu, select **Deploy**.

5. Select **Build your own template in the editor**.

6. Copy then paste the **/hands-on-lab/template.json** file contents to the window, then select **Save**.

7. Check the **I agree...** checkbox.

8. Select **Purchase**.

9. Navigate to the **Overview** dialog of the resource group, select **Deployments**, wait for the **Microsoft.template** deployment to succeed.  You can select it to review its progress.

   ![From the Resource group left menu, Deployments is highlighted. The deployment with the name Microsoft.Template is highlighted in the listing of deployments.](media/before-hol-azure-deploy-status.png 'Review the deployment process')

10. Select the **dev-1-nsg** network security group, in the list of newly created resources.

11. In the **Settings** section, select **Inbound Security rules**.

12. Select **+Add**.

13. For the source, select **IP Addresses**.

14. For the source IP, type your client IP Address.
    - You can get this by looking at your router, or using a service such as google by doing a search for `what is my ip`.
    
15. For the destination port range, type `3389`.

16. For the name, type `Port_3389`.

17. Select **Add**.

18. Select the **dev-1** vm, in the list of newly created resources.

      ![In the list of resources in the resource group, the virtual machine dev-1 is highlighted.](media/before-hol-azure-vm.png 'Select the dev-1 virtual  machine')

19. Select **Connect -> RDP** in the top menu navigation.

20. Select **Download RDP file**, then connect to the virtual machine.

21. Open Internet Explorer, download and install [Google Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome).

22. Set Google Chrome to the default browser.

23. Ensure your system updates are current. Run from an Administrator-level Windows PowerShell session (if running on a VM, you may safely ignore errors). This could take up to 30 minutes to complete.

      ```powershell
      Set-ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned

      Install-Module PSWindowsUpdate
      Import-Module PSWindowsUpdate
      Get-WindowsUpdate
      Install-WindowsUpdate
      ```

24. Install Chocolatey Windows package Manager.

      ```powershell
      Set-ExecutionPolicy Bypass -Scope Process -Force; iex ((New-Object System.Net.WebClient).DownloadString('https://chocolatey.org/install.ps1'))
      choco feature enable -n allowGlobalConfirmation
      ```

25. Install Azure CLI.

      ```powershell

      ```

31. Install SQL command line tools (includes **sqlcmd**).

    ```powershell
    choco install sqlserver-cmdlineutils
    ```

32. Install SQL Management Studio.

    ```powershell
    choco install sql-server-management-studio
    ```

33. Run the following commands separately in a **new Command Prompt window**.

    ```bash
    python -m pip install --upgrade pip

    pip3 install -U requests
    ```

    ```bash
    cd %USERPROFILE%\Downloads
    curl -o azdata.msi -L https://aka.ms/azdata-msi
    msiexec.exe /qn /i azdata.msi
    ```

34. Install the [Data Virtualization extension for Azure Data Studio](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/azure-data-studio/data-virtualization-extension?view=sql-server-ver15).
    - Open **Azure Data Studio**.
    - Click **View->Extensions**.
    - Select the **Data Virtualization** extension, then select **Install**.

### Task 2: Download lab files

Download a starter project that includes data files used in the lab.

1. Download the starter files by downloading a .zip copy of the Modernizing data analytics with SQL Server 2019 GitHub repo.

2. In a web browser, navigate to the [Modernizing data analytics with SQL Server 2019 MCW repo](https://github.com/Microsoft/MCW-Modernizing-data-analytics-with-SQL-Server-2019).

3. On the repo page, select **Code**, then select **Download ZIP**.

   ![On the repo page, the Clone or Download button is expanded with the Download Zip button selected.](media/github-download-repo.png 'Download ZIP')

4. Unzip the contents to your root hard drive (i.e. `C:\`). This will create a folder on your root drive named `MCW-Modernizing-data-analytics-with-SQL-Server-2019-master`.

### Task 3: Install SQL Server 2019 Big Data clusters

Open PowerShell and execute the following to deploy the clusters in preparation for the lab.

1. Before running the script, you must log in to your Azure account with Azure CLI at least once.

   ```bash
   az login
   ```

2. If you have multiple subscriptions, choose the appropriate subscription in which the resource should be billed. List all your subscriptions by entering the following into the shell:

   ```bash
   az account list
   ```

3. Select the specific subscription ID under your account using `az account set` command. Copy the `id` value from the output of the previous command for the subscription you wish to use into the `subscription id` placeholder:

   ```bash
   az account set --subscription <subscription id>
   ```

4. Switch to **Azure Data Studio**.

5. Select the **Connections** tab, then select the ellipsis (...) in Connections.

6. Select the **New Deployment** option.

   ![Azure Data Studio is displayed. In the CONNECTIONS section, the ellipsis next to the Connections header is expanded, and the Deploy SQL Server option is selected.](media/ads-deploy-sql-server.png 'Deploy SQL Server')

7. On the Select the deployment options, set the following values, then choose the **Select** button to continue:
   - For deployment template, select **SQL Server Big Data Cluster**.
   - Check the checkbox to accept the Microsoft Privacy Statement, SQL Server License Terms, and azdata license terms. Choose the **Select** button to continue.
   - Choose the following SQL Server Options:
     - **Version**: Select **SQL Server 2019**.
     - **Deployment Target**: Select **New Azure Kubernetes Service Cluster**.
   - In the Required tools section, ensure **kubectl**, **Azure CLI**, and **azdata** are present in the table.
  
   ![In the Select the deployment options screen, options are set to the previous values. The Select button is highlighted.](media/ads-deploy-bdc.png 'Deploy SQL Server Big Data Cluster')

   > **Note**: If the **Install tools** button is present, click it to install anything that may not have been installed in the above steps.

8. On the Step 1 Deployment configuration template panel, select **aks-dev-test**, and select **Next** to continue.

   ![The aks-dev-test configuration template is selected from the Step 1 Deployment Configuration Template panel. The Next button is highlighted.](media/ads-deploy-bdc-aks.png 'Deploy SQL Server Big Data Cluster on Azure Kubernetes Service')

9. On the Step 2 Azure Settings panel, set the following values, then select **Next** to continue:
   - **Subscription id**: Enter your subscription id that you are using for this lab. If you do not know your Subscription id, use the **View available Azure subscriptions** link located to the right of the textbox.
   - **New resource group name**: **mod-data-int**.
   - **Location**: Select a valid location for your AKS cluster from the dropdown list.
   - **AKS cluster name**: Give the cluster a name. By default, the name is `mssql-` followed by the date and time in UTC format.
   - **VM count**: Leave this as the default of **5**.
   - **VM size**: Leave this as the default of **Standard_E8s_v3**.

   ![On the Step 2 Azure settings panel, the form is filled in with the previously defined values. The Next button is highlighted.](media/ads-deploy-bdc-azure-settings.png 'Azure settings for deploying a SQL Server Big Data Cluster on Azure Kubernetes Service')

   > **Note**: Your hourly price will depend upon region, VM size, and VM count, but you can estimate this using the [Azure pricing website](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/pricing/details/virtual-machines/ubuntu-advantage-essential/).

10. On the Step 3 Cluster settings panel, set the following values, then select **Next** to continue:
    - **Cluster name**: Retain the default `mssql-cluster`.
    - **Admin username**: Retain the default `admin`.
    - **Password**: Set a password that you will remember. The password you choose here will be your password for the controller, the master SQL Server instance, and the Knox gateway.
    - **Authentication mode**: **Basic**.
  
      ![On the Step 3 Cluster settings panel, the form is filled in with the previously defined values. The Next button is highlighted.](media/ads-deploy-bdc-cluster-settings.png 'Cluster settings for d4ploying a SQL Server Big Data Cluster on Azure Kubernetes Service')

      > **Please note:**  Some of the steps in this hands-on lab use Windows batch scripts to perform operations.  Windows batch scripts have a set of special characters which you should not use in your password.  Examples of safe special characters to use are `@`, `#`, and `$`, as these do not have any special meaning for Windows batch scripts. If you wish to use an exclamation point (`!`), your batch script calls will need to include four carets (`^`) before each exclamation point.  That is, if your password is `ThisIsMyPassword!`, then you will need to enter it as `ThisIsMyPassword^^^^!` when you call the Windows batch script.

11. Review the scale settings, we will **leave all of the defaults**, including endpoints for the labs. The default values will be based off of the deployment configuration template, but you have the opportunity to change these if you would like. When finished, select the **Next** button.

   ![The Step 4 Service settings page is filled with with default values. The Next button is highlighted.](media/ads-deploy-bdc-service-settings.png 'Service settings for deploying a SQL Server Big Data Cluster on Azure Kubernetes Service')

12. On the Step 5 Summary panel, review the summary to ensure that your settings are correct. Once finished, select the **Script to Notebook** button.

   ![The Summary page has our cluster details and a Script to Notebook button which we will select.](media/ads-deploy-bdc-summary.png 'Summary details our SQL Server Big Data Cluster')

13. If you have never run a notebook before, Azure Data Studio will ask you to choose a new Python installation or, if you have one already, an existing installation.  We will choose to use a new installation of Python to avoid any permissions issues with existing installations of Python.  Choose the **Install** button.  As Azure Data Studio configures Jupyter notebooks and installs necessary components, it will write messages to the Output buffer.

   ![The Configure Python for Notebooks dialog is displayed with an installation type of "New Python installation" selected and the Install button is highlighted.](media/ads-configure-python-for-notebooks.png 'Configure Python for Notebooks')

14. After Azure Data Studio finishes configuration, run each step of the notebook by selecting the "play" button next to each code block in order. It may take a few moments to start the python kernel and execute the first step, you can watch the `output` window for status.
       - If prompted to upgrade python packages, select **Yes**.
       - You may need to log into Azure when running block 5, which executes `az login`.  
  
      > **Note**: When you get to the `az aks create` command, you may run into an error when creating the cluster.  This is a known [issue](https://github.com/Azure/azure-cli/issues/9585) that may be resolved in the latest Azure CLI (April 2020+).  If you receive an error, you will need to add new steps to create a service principal and then prompt for the client id and secret to create the cluster.

      ```python
      run_command('az ad sp create-for-rbac --skip-assignment')

      client_id = input("Enter the client id (appId above) : ")
      client_secret = input("Enter the client secret (password above): ")

      # Update the az aks create command
      run_command(f'az aks create --name {aks_cluster_name} --resource-group {azure_resource_group} --generate-ssh-keys --node-vm-size {azure_vm_size} --node-count {azure_vm_count} --service-principal {client_id} --client-secret {client_secret}')
      ```

      > **Note**:  Some of these steps, such as creating the Azure Kubernetes Service cluster and creating the SQL Server 2019 Big Data Cluster, may take upwards of 30 minutes to complete.  Read each respective step to determine commands you can run to check the status.

      ![The Big Data Cluster deployment notebook is shown with the Run cell command highlighted as an example of how to run a cell.](media/ads-deploy-bdc-notebook.png 'Running the notebook to deploy a SQL Server Big Data Cluster')

15. The final step of the notebook will allow you to connect to your Big Data Cluster master instance using Azure Data Studio. Run the step and then select the link to connect to your SQL Server master instance.

   ![In the notebook in the Connect to SQL Server Master instance in Azure Data Studio section, the Click here to connect to SQL Server master instance link is highlighted.](media/ads-deploy-bdc-connect.png 'Connect to a SQL Server master instance')

16. Once you have run through each step, save the notebook.  This notebook will contain information on all of your Big Data Cluster endpoints, which you will need throughout the lab.

### Task 4: Install sample databases and upload files

1. Open a new Windows Explorer window.  Navigate to the Hands-on lab's Resources folder. If you followed along with Step 4 of Task 2, it will be at `C:\MCW-Modernizing-data-analytics-with-SQL-Server-2019-master\Hands-on lab\Resources\`.

   - Review the contents of the script file.

2. Switch to Windows command prompt.

3. Run the script named **bootstrap-sample-db.cmd**. Substitute `<MSSQL_CLUSTER_NAME>`, `<SQL_MASTER_IP>`, `<SQL_MASTER_ADMIN_PASSWORD>`, `<KNOX_IP>`, `<KNOX_PASSWORD>` with values output from the SQL Server 2019 cluster creation notebook above.  Halfway through the execution of this script, you may need to hit a key to have it continue.  This script will download and restore a database called `sales` to your Big Data cluster.

   ```bash
   cd "C:\MCW-Modernizing-data-analytics-with-SQL-Server-2019-master\Hands-on lab\Resources\"

   .\bootstrap-sample-db.cmd <MSSQL_CLUSTER_NAME> <SQL_MASTER_IP> <SQL_MASTER_ADMIN_PASSWORD> <KNOX_IP> <KNOX_PASSWORD> --install-extra-samples
   ```

   | Parameter                   | Description                                                                 |
   | --------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------  |
   | <CLUSTER_NAMESPACE>         | The name you gave your big data cluster (**mssql-cluster** in our example). |
   | <SQL_MASTER_IP>             | The IP address of your master SQL Server Master Instance                                      |
   | <SQL_MASTER_ADMIN_PASSWORD> | The SA password for the master instance (Password you entered above).                                    |
   | <KNOX_IP>                   | The IP address of the gateway to access HDFS files, Spark.                                   |
   | <KNOX_PASSWORD>             | The same as your admin password  (Password you entered above).
   | --install-extra-samples     | Uploads database backup files for AdventureWorks and Wide World Importers   |

   > **Note**: You can also use kubectl to find the IP addresses for the SQL Server master instance and Knox. Run `kubectl get svc -n <your-big-data-cluster-name>` and look at the EXTERNAL-IP addresses for the master instance (**master-svc-external**) and Knox (**gateway-svc-external**).

4. Run the script named **upload-sample-files.cmd**. Substitute `<KNOX_IP>`, `<KNOX_PASSWORD>` with values output from the SQL Server 2019 cluster creation script above.  This script will copy various sample files used in the labs.

   ```bash
   .\upload-sample-files.cmd <KNOX_IP> <KNOX_PASSWORD>
   ```

   | Parameter       | Description                               |
   | --------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
   | <KNOX_IP>       | The IP address of the HDFS/Spark Gateway. |
   | <KNOX_PASSWORD> | The same as your SA password.             |

### Task 5: Create sample Azure SQL Database

In this lab, you will be using an Azure SQL Database as a source for virtual tables within your SQL Server 2019 cluster. Follow these steps to create a new Azure SQL Server Database instance and configure its firewall.

1. Navigate to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com).

2. Select the **WWI_Commerce** database resource.

3. On the Overview pane, select **Set server firewall** to add your IP address.

    ![On the Overview pane of the SQL database, the Set server firewall item is highlighted on the toolbar.](media/azure-sql-set-server-firewall-link.png 'Overview blade')

4. Select **+ Add client IP** to automatically add your system's IP address, and make sure **Allow access to Azure services** is set to **ON**.

5. Select **Save** to apply your changes.

    ![On the Firewall settings screen, the + Add client IP button is highlighted in the toolbar, and the toggle for Allow access to Azure services is set to **ON**.](media/azure-sql-set-server-firewall.png 'Firewall settings')

6. Choose **Query editor** from the left-hand menu. When prompted, type **ServerAdmin** for the Login name, and **MySQLBigData2019** for the password, then select **OK** to log in.

    ![In the left menu of the SQL Database resource, the Query editor item is selected. In the content pane, a SQL server authentication form is displayed populated with the above values and the OK button is selected.](media/azure-sql-query-editor-login.png 'Query editor')

7. Paste the following into the query window, then execute. This creates a new Reviews table with data.

    ```sql
